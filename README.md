## Most recent/important talks given at conferences/meetups

In the last 5 years I gave about 50 talks at various data science and machine learning conferences and meetups. Some of these talks have been video recorded and are publicly available online. Many of them have been on the same topic, but with content gradually updated with results from new findings (so older talks have been superseded by newer ones). This repo aims to keep a pointer to the most up-to-date recorded talk in each of the most important topics. 


### Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM/GBDT) / Machine learning benchmarks

### Machine learning in production / in business applications / best practices

Best practices for using machine learning in businesses have been discused in my keynote to the Budapest BI & Analytics Forum conference in Nov 2018. That talk has not been recorded, but I gave a "replay" of it in the Use cases seminar for the MS in Business Analytics at CEU (University) in May 2019,

In addition, I walked through the whole workflow for developing machine learning models and deploying them in production in a talk at the LA Data Science/Machine Learning meetup in May 2017,

### Using R for data science

The 2 tools most widely used for data science in the last few years are R and Python. I have been using R since 2006, and I gave a talk about my journey and some best practices in using R for data science at the Budapest Data Science meetup in Aug 2015,
